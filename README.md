Notiongram is a integration that allow your Saved Messages (like chat yourself) from Telegram become pages to Notion.

## **Easier, Simpler and Faster!**

The idea is that you send a message to *yourself* on Telegram and synchronize with Notion by storing it in a database as pages.

It's pretty simple, no?

> In the future, it's intended create tasks by the same messages, but with a simple notation.
